React Native:
Pros: Allows for a single codebase for both iOS and Android, reducing development time and effort. It has a large community and plenty of libraries to facilitate development.
Cons: May not provide the same level of performance as native apps, and certain native features may require custom native modules.

Native Development:
Pros: Offers the best performance and access to all native features. Provides a more tailored experience for each platform.
Cons: Requires separate codebases for iOS and Android, leading to increased development time and maintenance efforts.

Decision:
React Native was chosen because the goal is to develop a cross-platform app efficiently. The trade-off in performance is acceptable given the benefits of faster development and easier maintenance. Additionally, the ability to share most of the code between platforms significantly reduces the workload.

2. MongoDB vs. MySQL

MongoDB:
Pros: Schema-less design allows for flexibility in data storage. It's well-suited for handling unstructured data and scaling horizontally. Ideal for applications with rapidly changing data structures.
Cons: Lacks support for complex transactions compared to relational databases. May require more careful planning for data relationships.

MySQL:
Pros: Mature, well-supported, and offers robust transaction support. Ideal for structured data and complex queries.
Cons: Less flexible in terms of schema changes. Scaling can be more challenging compared to NoSQL databases.

Decision:
MongoDB was chosen due to its flexibility and scalability, which align with the needs of the project. The ability to handle unstructured data and easily adapt to changes in the data model is critical for a finance management app where requirements might evolve. The trade-off of not having complex transaction support is acceptable given the application's initial scope and the advantages in flexibility.

Infrastructure
Branching and Merging Strategy
We will use the GitHub Flow strategy for branching and merging to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow:
Main Branch: The main branch will always contain the production-ready code. It should be deployable at all times.
Feature Branches: Each new feature or bug fix will be developed in its own branch, named descriptively (e.g., feature-login, bugfix-header).
Pull Requests: Once a feature or fix is complete, a pull request (PR) will be created to merge the feature branch into the main branch. Code reviews and automated tests must pass before merging.
Continuous Integration (CI): Every push to a feature branch will trigger CI pipelines to run automated tests, ensuring code quality and functionality before merging.

Deployment Strategy
Staging Environment: We will have a staging environment that mirrors the production environment. This is where features will be tested in a production-like setting before deployment.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Upon merging a pull request into the main branch, the code will be automatically deployed to the staging environment. If all tests pass and the staging environment is verified, the code will be promoted to production.
Rollback Plan: In case of issues, we will have a rollback plan to revert to the previous stable version of the application.

Data Population Strategy
Initial Data Setup: Upon first launch, the app will prompt users to link their bank accounts using the Plaid API. This will automatically import their financial transactions and account balances.
Manual Data Entry: Users will also have the option to manually enter their financial transactions if they prefer not to link their bank accounts.
Sample Data for Testing: During development and testing phases, we will use sample datasets to populate the app. This will help simulate real-world scenarios and ensure the app functions correctly with various types of data.
Testing Tools and Processes

Automated Testing:
Unit Tests: Using Jest for JavaScript and TypeScript unit tests to ensure individual components and functions work as expected.
Integration Tests: Using Enzyme along with Jest to test interactions between components and ensure they work together correctly.
End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Using tools like Cypress to simulate real user interactions and test the entire application workflow from start to finish.
Continuous Integration (CI):
CI pipelines will run all automated tests on every push to any branch, ensuring immediate feedback on code quality.
Tools like GitHub Actions or CircleCI will be used to automate these processes.
Manual Testing:
In addition to automated tests, QA engineers will perform manual testing to catch any issues that automated tests might miss.
User acceptance testing (UAT) will be conducted in the staging environment to ensure the app meets user expectations before final deployment.


Code Quality Tools:
ESLint for linting JavaScript and TypeScript code to maintain consistent code quality and style.
Prettier for code formatting to ensure a consistent codebase.
